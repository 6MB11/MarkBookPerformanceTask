# MarkBook Performance Task

ICS4U Performance Task. Based off a small amount of scaffolding from the Programmer's Heaven C# School book by Faraz Rasheed.

This program is my take on the MarkBook software at https://acadiem-group.odoo.com/, hopefully with a few improvements.

There are probably a few ways to run this program, the first one that I got to work was using GitHub Desktop to clone the repository and running the .sln file locally.
